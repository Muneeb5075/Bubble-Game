Bubble Hit Game ðŸŽ¯ðŸŸ¢
The Bubble Hit Game is a fast-paced, interactive web game where players must click the correct bubble to earn points. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an engaging way to test reflexes and improve focus.

How It Works:
When the game starts, a hit number is displayed at the top of the panel.
Random bubbles with numbers between 0 and 9 are generated dynamically on the screen.
Players have 60 seconds to find and click the bubble that matches the displayed hit number.
If the player clicks the correct bubble, their score increases by 10 points, and a new set of bubbles is generated along with a new hit number.
If the player clicks the wrong bubble, they receive an alert indicating the mistake.
The game ends when the timer reaches zero, displaying a "Game Over" message.

Features:
Dynamic Bubble Generation: The game generates 102 random bubbles on each round.
Real-Time Updates: The timer, hit number, and score are updated in real-time during gameplay.
User Feedback: Alerts notify the player if they click the wrong bubble.
Responsive Design: The game panel is styled with CSS to ensure a clean, modern look and a smooth user experience.
Restart on Completion: Once the game ends, players can refresh the page to start a new session.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the game interface.
CSS: For styling, including layout and hover effects.
JavaScript: For game logic, bubble generation, and event handling.
